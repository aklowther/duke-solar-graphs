<h3>The information in the first graph comes directly from my <a href="https://www.duke-energy.com/home">Duke Energy</a> bill.</h3>
<br>In this graph: <br>
<ul>
  <li>"Consumed From Grid" shows the number of kW(h) I used from Duke
    <ul> <li> I do not have a battery, so I rely on the grid when the sun isn't out</li></ul>
  <li>"Sent to Grid" shows the energy I created in excess of what was being used</li>
  <li>"kWh Balance" is the total excess I've sent to Duke, providing me a kWh credit</li>
</ul>
